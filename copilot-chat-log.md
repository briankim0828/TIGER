Project Goal: Data Flow & Architecture Overhaul

The user wants to refactor the application's data architecture from its current state to a more robust, relational model.

**Current Problems:**
*   The data model relies on nested JSON structures with manually-defined, arbitrary TypeScript types in index.ts.
*   Data persistence is handled by `AsyncStorage` (data.ts), which acts as a simple key-value store, and is not relational.
*   State management (DataContext.tsx, WorkoutContext.tsx) is centered around holding large, in-memory copies of the data, which is inefficient and not scalable.
*   Synchronization with Supabase is manual and incomplete, used more as a backup than a source of truth.

**Target Architecture:**
*   **Database:** A local SQL database will be the single source of truth.
*   **Synchronization:** Use **ElectricSQL** to handle reactivity and bi-directional synchronization between the local database and the main Supabase Postgres database.
*   **ORM:** Use **Drizzle ORM** to define the database schema and execute queries. Types will be automatically generated from this schema.
*   **Data Flow:** The application will shift from a state-centric model to a database-centric one. UI components will subscribe directly to live queries from the local database, automatically re-rendering when data changes.

**High-Level Implementation Plan:**
1.  **Replace the Data Layer:**
    *   Discard data.ts and the manual types in index.ts.
    *   Define a new, normalized database schema using Drizzle.
    *   Configure ElectricSQL to manage the local database and sync with Supabase.
2.  **Refactor State Management:**
    *   Modify `DataContext` to provide the database client instead of holding data in state.
    *   Rewrite `WorkoutContext` so that its functions (`startWorkout`, `endWorkout`, etc.) perform transactional database operations directly, rather than manipulating an in-memory object.
3.  **Adapt UI Components:**
    *   Replace data fetching logic (`useData()`) in components with ElectricSQL's `useLiveQuery` hooks.
    *   Update component props to use the new, Drizzle-generated types.
    *   Connect user actions (button presses, etc.) to functions that execute database mutations via Drizzle.

### **Project Plan: Application Data Architecture Overhaul**

#### **Checkpoint 0 — Foundations & Tooling**

This initial step prepares the project with foundational utilities and dependencies, setting the stage for the new architecture without altering existing logic.

1.  **Install Core Dependencies:**
    *   **Action:** Modify package.json to add the required packages for the new stack.
    *   **Command:**
        ```bash
        npm install drizzle-orm electric-sql @electric-sql/react-native @electric-sql/drizzle-orm-driver uuid
        npm install --save-dev drizzle-kit tsx @types/uuid
        ```

2.  **Establish Foundational Utilities:**
    *   **Action:** Create a utility for generating client-side UUIDs. This ensures all new entities have unique, sync-friendly primary keys.
    *   **File to Create:** `src/utils/uuid.ts` to export a function that generates v4 UUIDs.
    *   **Action:** Update ids.ts to use this new UUID generator, deprecating its existing logic.

3.  **Configure Tooling:**
    *   **Action:** Create `drizzle.config.ts` in the root directory. This file will point `drizzle-kit` to your Supabase database for generating migrations and to the schema definition file.

---

#### **Checkpoint 1 — Model Definition & Generation**

Here, we define the canonical data model using Drizzle, from which all database tables, migrations, and application types will be derived.

1.  **Define the Schema:**
    *   **Action:** Create the single source of truth for your data model.
    *   **File to Create:** `src/db/schema.ts`.
    *   **Details:** Based on the conceptual model you will provide, define all tables (`users`, `splits`, `exercises`, `workouts`, etc.) using Drizzle's `pgTable` syntax. All `id` columns will be of type `uuid`.

2.  **Generate Types and Migrations:**
    *   **Action:** Run `drizzle-kit` to generate the initial SQL migration script and the corresponding TypeScript types.
    *   **Result:** This process validates the schema and creates the first migration file in a new `drizzle` directory. The generated types will replace the hand-written ones in index.ts later.

---

#### **Checkpoint 2 — Local DB & Sync Integration**

This checkpoint focuses on wiring up the local database and the synchronization engine, making the database available to the entire application.

1.  **Initialize ElectricSQL:**
    *   **Action:** Create a provider to manage the ElectricSQL client and the connection to the local database.
    *   **File to Create:** `src/electric/provider.tsx`. This component will initialize the client, open the database, run migrations, and provide the electrified Drizzle instance via React Context.

2.  **Integrate Provider into the App:**
    *   **Action:** Wrap the application's root with the new provider.
    *   **File to Modify:** App.tsx. The `<ElectricProvider>` will be placed high in the component tree, ensuring all screens and components can access the database.

3.  **Create Data Access Layer:**
    *   **Action:** Create a new directory `src/db/queries` to hold functions that interact with the database.
    *   **Files to Create:** Start with `src/db/queries/splits.ts` and `src/db/queries/exercises.ts`. These will contain functions like `getSplits`, `addSplit`, `getExercises`, etc., which use the Drizzle client.

---

#### **Checkpoint 3 — Refactor the "Program Builder" Flow**

This is the first feature to be migrated. We will swap out the data handling for `MySplits` and `SplitDetailScreen` to use the new local database.

1.  **Adapt UI Components:**
    *   **Files to Modify:** `src/screens/MySplits.tsx` and SplitDetailScreen.tsx.
    *   **Action:** Replace data fetching from `useData()` with ElectricSQL's `useLiveQuery` hook, calling the query functions created in the previous step (e.g., `useLiveQuery(db.query.splits.findMany())`).
    *   **Action:** Update all button presses and actions (create, update, delete) to call the new mutation functions (e.g., `addSplit(db, newSplit)`).

2.  **Deprecate Old State Management:**
    *   **File to Modify:** DataContext.tsx.
    *   **Action:** Remove the state variables (`splits`, `exercises`) and data manipulation functions related to the program builder. The context becomes much leaner, as components now get their data directly from the database.

---

#### **Checkpoint 4 — Refactor "Start Workout" & Live Logging**

This checkpoint tackles the core interactive feature: running a workout. We will refactor the `WorkoutContext` to be a set of transactional database operations.

1.  **Rewrite Workout Logic:**
    *   **File to Modify:** WorkoutContext.tsx.
    *   **Action:** The `startWorkout` function will now be a database transaction that creates a `workouts` record and its associated `workout_exercises`. It will no longer create a large in-memory object.
    *   **Action:** Functions like `addSet` and `updateSet` will become atomic mutations that write directly to the `workout_sets` table in the local database.
    *   **Action:** `endWorkout` will simply update the status and duration of the `workouts` record.

2.  **Adapt Workout UI:**
    *   **Files to Modify:** WorkoutScreen.tsx and ActiveWorkoutModal.tsx.
    *   **Action:** The UI will use `useLiveQuery` to subscribe to the currently active workout, its exercises, and its sets.
    *   **Action:** The component will no longer hold workout data in React state. It will only need the `workout_id` to fetch the relevant data. As `addSet` and other functions update the database, the UI will re-render automatically.

---

#### **Checkpoint 5 — Retire Legacy Systems**

With all features migrated, we can now safely remove the old, obsolete code.

1.  **Remove `AsyncStorage` Persistence:**
    *   **Action:** Delete data.ts. All its functionality is now handled by the local database.

2.  **Remove Manual Types:**
    *   **Action:** Delete index.ts. The entire application will now use the types generated by Drizzle from `src/db/schema.ts`.

3.  **Clean Up Supabase Integration:**
    *   **Action:** Review the files in supabase. The Supabase client will likely be kept for authentication, but all functions related to manual data fetching and writing (`supabaseSplits.ts`, `supabaseWorkout.ts`, etc.) will be deleted.

4.  **Finalize Context Cleanup:**
    *   **Action:** Delete DataContext.tsx entirely, as its responsibilities have been fully absorbed by direct database queries in the components.

---

#### **Checkpoint 6 — Cloud Deployment & Verification**

The final step is to set up the cloud environment and ensure everything syncs correctly.

1.  **Initialize Cloud Database:**
    *   **Action:** Create a new, empty project in Supabase.
    *   **Action:** Apply the Drizzle-generated migrations to the cloud database to create the table structure.

2.  **Configure Row-Level Security (RLS):**
    *   **Action:** In Supabase, define RLS policies on all tables to ensure users can only access their own data. Policies will typically check that `auth.uid() == user_id`.

3.  **End-to-End Sync Test:**
    *   **Action:** Run the application and verify that data created locally is correctly synced to the Supabase project. Test offline capabilities by disabling network access, making changes, and then re-enabling to watch the sync complete.


# 2025-08-15

### **Project: Application Data Architecture Overhaul**

#### **What We've Done So Far:**

We have successfully completed **Checkpoint 0** and **Checkpoint 1** of the project plan.

1.  **Foundations & Tooling (Checkpoint 0):**
    *   Installed all necessary dependencies for the new data stack, including `expo-sqlite`, `drizzle-orm`, `electric-sql`, and `uuid`.
    *   Installed the required development dependencies, such as `drizzle-kit` and `tsx`.
    *   Created a new utility for generating UUIDs (uuid.ts) and updated the old ID generation logic to use it.
    *   Configured drizzle.config.ts to connect to your Supabase database.

2.  **Model Definition & Generation (Checkpoint 1):**
    *   Defined a comprehensive and strongly-typed database schema in schema.ts based on your application's features.
    *   Set up the .env file with your Supabase database connection string and added it to .gitignore to keep it secure.
    *   Generated the initial SQL migration file (0000_romantic_pet_avengers.sql), which creates the database structure based on the new schema.

#### **Next Steps:**

We are now ready to begin **Checkpoint 2: Local DB & Sync Integration**. The immediate next steps are:

1.  **Initialize ElectricSQL:** Create a provider component (`src/electric/provider.tsx`) to manage the ElectricSQL client and the connection to the local database.
2.  **Integrate Provider:** Wrap the root of the application in App.tsx with the new provider to make the database accessible everywhere.
3.  **Create Data Access Layer:** Begin creating query functions in a new `src/db/queries` directory to interact with the database.

# 2025-08-20

Checkpoint 2: Local DB & Sync Integration - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented a local database integration with a simplified data access layer. While full ElectricSQL integration proved complex due to schema compatibility issues, we created a working foundation that provides all essential functionality.

## What was implemented:

```typescript
import { useDatabase } from '../db/queries';

function MyComponent() {
  const db = useDatabase();
  
  // Get user's splits
  const splits = await db.getUserSplits('user-id');
  
  // Create a new split
  await db.createSplit({
    name: 'Push Day',
    userId: 'user-id',
    color: '#FF6B6B'
  });
  
  // Start a workout session
  await db.createWorkoutSession({
    userId: 'user-id',
    splitId: 'split-id'
  });
}
```


## Next Steps:

With Checkpoint 2 complete, the app now has:
- ✅ Local SQLite database running

Checkpoint 3: Program Builder Refactor — COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Migrated the entire Program Builder flow (MyProgram, MySplits, SplitDetail, ExerciseSelection, and the MyExercises pane within WorkoutScreen) from legacy state/Supabase calls to a database‑centric model on local SQLite. Introduced a robust, typed data access layer, added persistent day assignments, upgraded the exercises schema with a `body_part` column, and seeded a full exercise catalog. The UI now refreshes reliably via focus‑based refetch and deterministic ordering; casts and `any` types were removed by introducing clear UI and data row types.

## Dataflow Overview (before → after)

- Before
  - Components pulled large in‑memory structures from DataContext, mutated them locally, and optionally synced to Supabase.
  - Lists were often re‑derived by mapping/transforms in UI, with ad‑hoc casts and fragile prop shapes.
- After
  - Database is the single source of truth. Components call a small, typed data access API and render from returned rows.
  - Screens trigger explicit refetches on navigation focus and after mutations to keep UI consistent without in‑memory mirrors.
  - Derived data (exercise counts, day assignments, per‑split exercises) is fetched from purpose‑built queries.
  - Naming, ordering, and grouping are handled at the data layer (or via persisted columns such as `body_part`).

## What was implemented

### ✅ Part 1: Data layer extensions and schema upgrades
- File: `src/db/queries/simple.ts`
  - Splits
    - `getUserSplits(userId)` and `getUserSplitsWithExerciseCounts(userId)` with `ORDER BY created_at ASC` so newly created splits appear at the bottom.
    - `createSplit`, `updateSplit`, `deleteSplit` with sequential name generation on create (handled at the caller level, see WorkoutScreen).
  - Day assignments
    - New `split_day_assignments` table; `getDayAssignments(splitId)` and `setDayAssignment(splitId, weekday, value)` to persist weekly schedule per split.
  - Split exercises
    - `getSplitExercises(splitId)` returns a join (`SplitExerciseJoin`) including exercise fields for rendering.
    - `addExercisesToSplit(splitId, exerciseIds, { avoidDuplicates: true })` inserts while preventing dupes and appends to end.
    - `removeExerciseFromSplit(splitExerciseId)` removes and then normalizes `order_pos` to be contiguous (0..n-1).
    - `reorderSplitExercises(splitId, nextOrderIds)` applies a client-provided order and re‑normalizes.
  - Exercises schema & seeding
    - Added `exercises.body_part` column via a lightweight migration (with a simple backfill for existing rows when possible).
    - All read paths select `body_part` and map to `bodyPart` in returned objects.
    - `seedSampleData()` imports a canonical catalog `DEFAULT_EXERCISES_BY_BODY_PART`, infers each exercise `kind` (e.g., cardio vs strength), and persists `bodyPart` for grouping in the UI.
- Types exported by the data layer (for screens to consume without casts):
  - `SplitRow`, `SplitWithCountRow`, `ExerciseRow` (includes `bodyPart`), `SplitExerciseJoin`.

### ✅ Part 2: UI refactors to use the DB and typed props
- File: `src/screens/WorkoutScreen.tsx`
  - Fetches splits with exercise counts and day assignments for MyProgram/MySplits.
  - Hydrates per‑split exercises on demand to build `ProgramSplitWithExercises` for the MyExercises section.
  - Implements focus‑based refresh (on navigation focus) and refetch after mutations (create, delete, reassign, reorder).
  - Sequential naming for new splits and deterministic ordering (created_at ASC).
- Files: `src/components/MyProgram.tsx`, `src/components/MySplits.tsx`
  - Props converted to typed shapes (`ProgramSplit` and `ProgramEditMode`), showing exercise counts and respecting edit mode.
  - Minimal `// @ts-ignore` retained only for icon prop typing quirks from the UI library.
- File: `src/screens/SplitDetailScreen.tsx`
  - Loads, removes, and reorders split exercises directly via the data layer.
  - Maps DB join rows (`SplitExerciseJoin`) to the view model without casts; changes persist immediately.
- File: `src/components/ExerciseSelectionView.tsx`
  - Loads the exercise catalog (`ExerciseRow[]`) from the DB and groups by `bodyPart` for display.
  - Adds exercises with duplicate avoidance to the target split.
- File: `src/components/MyExercises.tsx`
  - Renders aggregated exercises from `ProgramSplitWithExercises`; groups by `bodyPart`; no `any[]` usage.

### ✅ Part 3: Typing consolidation to eliminate casts
- UI (view‑model) types in `src/types/ui.ts`
  - `ProgramSplit` — canonical shape for a split in Program Builder UI.
  - `ProgramEditMode` — edit state representation for list manipulation.
  - `ProgramExerciseLite` — small, reusable descriptor for exercise items in list UIs.
  - `ProgramSplitWithExercises` — a split paired with its exercises for the MyExercises view.
- Data layer row types (exported from queries)
  - `SplitRow`, `SplitWithCountRow`, `ExerciseRow` (includes `bodyPart`), `SplitExerciseJoin` for joined results.
- Boundary mapping
  - Maintain snake_case ↔ camelCase mapping only at the data layer (e.g., `body_part` ↔ `bodyPart`), keeping UI code camelCase‑only.

## Key Features Implemented

### Database & Ordering Behavior
- Deterministic list ordering for splits by `created_at ASC` (new splits at the bottom for stable UX).
- Contiguous `order_pos` enforcement for split exercises across add/remove/reorder to keep drag/reorder logic reliable.
- Duplicate avoidance when adding exercises to a split (idempotent “add” behavior).

### React Integration & Refresh Strategy
- Stable database client instance via a memoized `useDatabase()` hook (prevents render loops and redundant re‑initialization).
- Focus‑based refetch and post‑mutation refetch provide predictable UI updates without maintaining parallel in‑memory state.
- Screens/components read directly from the DB, minimizing intermediate state and eliminating legacy DataContext usage in Program Builder.

### Schema & Seeding for Better UX
- Persisted `body_part` enables native grouping in selection and exercise views without ad‑hoc classification in UI code.
- Seeded a comprehensive exercise catalog for immediate, realistic selection and filtering.

### Known Exceptions
- A small number of `// @ts-ignore` comments remain for icon props due to third‑party typings. These are isolated, documented, and safe.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { useDatabase } from '@/src/db/queries';

function ProgramBuilderExample() {
  const db = useDatabase();

  // 1) List splits with counts (ordered by created_at ASC)
  const splits = await db.getUserSplitsWithExerciseCounts('user-id');

  // 2) Assign a weekday for a split
  await db.setDayAssignment('split-id', 'Monday', true);

  // 3) Add exercises to a split (avoid duplicates)
  await db.addExercisesToSplit('split-id', ['exercise-id-1', 'exercise-id-2'], { avoidDuplicates: true });

  // 4) Reorder split exercises
  await db.reorderSplitExercises('split-id', ['split-exercise-id-2', 'split-exercise-id-1']);

  // 5) Load full exercise catalog with bodyPart for grouping
  const allExercises = await db.getAllExercises(); // ExerciseRow[] with bodyPart
}
```

## Practical Implementation Notes

- Keep the DB client stable:
  - Always use `useDatabase()` from `src/db/queries/index.ts` to obtain the memoized instance.
- Refresh patterns:
  - Use navigation focus listeners to refetch lists; also refetch after creating/removing/reordering to keep view state in sync.
- Ordering and naming:
  - Rely on `created_at ASC` for list order and perform sequential naming on create to avoid collisions (e.g., “New Split 1”, “New Split 2”, …).
- Reorder logic:
  - After any reorder/remove, normalize `order_pos` to contiguous values. Treat the provided order list as source of truth, then re‑index.
- Mapping discipline:
  - Only the data layer should translate snake_case columns to camelCase fields; UI code stays camelCase and typed.

## How to Extend This in Checkpoint 4 (Guidance)

- Follow the same patterns for Active Workout:
  - Replace in‑memory workout objects with transactional DB operations (create a workout, insert its exercises and sets).
  - Subscribe or refetch (until live queries are introduced) to keep the Active Workout UI fresh.
  - Introduce typed row shapes for workouts, workout_exercises, and workout_sets; add minimal UI types for any composite view models.
- Prefer idempotent mutations and contiguous ordering where lists are user‑reorderable (e.g., active workout exercise order).
- Keep mapping at the data boundary; do not leak snake_case into components.
- Plan for a later migration to Drizzle/Electric live queries: design functions so their signatures map cleanly to ORM equivalents.

## Technical Notes

- Database: SQLite via expo‑sqlite (ElectricSQL planned later for live sync).
- Types: Lightweight, purpose‑built UI types remove casts while keeping migration to ORM‑generated types feasible.
- Performance: Direct SQL queries; consider indexes such as `split_exercises(split_id)` as data volume grows.
- Seeding: Uses a canonical catalog with inferred `kind` and persisted `bodyPart`.

## Next Steps

- Optional polish
  - Parallelize per‑split exercise hydration when rendering large lists.
  - Add indexes where query volume grows (e.g., `split_exercises(split_id)`).
- Checkpoint 4
  - Refactor WorkoutContext to transactional operations on the DB (start/end workout, add/update sets) and wire Active Workout UI to read from the DB with refresh/live patterns.
  - Later, adopt Drizzle/Electric for generated types and live queries to remove the custom query layer.


## 2025-08-23 - 2

Checkpoint 3.5: Program Builder on Drizzle (SQLite) — COMPLETED ✅

This incremental checkpoint moved the Program Builder dataflow from raw SQL strings to a typed Drizzle ORM layer on top of Expo SQLite, without changing UI code or method signatures. It keeps the refactor low‑risk and sets up a clean path to Electric live queries and cloud sync later.

### What changed (code + dataflow)

- Introduced a local sqlite‑oriented Drizzle schema
  - File: `src/db/sqlite/schema.ts`
  - Tables mirrored from current local SQLite: `exercises`, `splits`, `split_exercises`, `split_day_assignments`.
  - Added a unique composite index on `split_day_assignments (user_id, weekday)` to support upserts (matches legacy UNIQUE constraint).

- Swapped Program Builder’s data-access to Drizzle (reads + writes)
  - File: `src/db/queries/programBuilder.drizzle.ts`
  - Reads: `getAllExercises`, `getUserSplits`, `getUserSplitsWithExerciseCounts` (LEFT JOIN + COUNT), `getSplitExercises` (JOIN + ORDER), `getDayAssignments`.
  - Writes: `createSplit`, `updateSplit`, `deleteSplit`, `setDayAssignment` (upsert by unique key), `addExercisesToSplit` (avoid duplicates + contiguous order), `removeExerciseFromSplit` (renormalize order), `reorderSplitExercises`, `createExercise`.
  - Return shapes and method signatures preserved exactly, so UI/components didn’t change.

- Hook now returns the Drizzle-backed class
  - File: `src/db/queries/index.ts`
  - `useDatabase()` memoizes and returns `new ProgramBuilderDataAccess(db)`.

- Postgres schema alignment for future sync (earlier change)
  - File: `src/db/schema.ts` (Drizzle Postgres schema)
  - Added `bodyPart` to the exercise catalog so local grouping aligns with future cloud sync. Not used at runtime yet; current runtime is local SQLite.

- Cleanup
  - Removed an unused sqlite proxy client that referenced a missing package to avoid TS noise.

### Conceptual impact

- Low‑risk “internal swap”
  - The UI stayed the same. We replaced the internals: raw SQL → Drizzle query builder and typed table objects.
  - We kept the same API contract at the boundary (method names, args, return shapes) to avoid touching screens.

- ORM boundary in place
  - The data layer now has ORM semantics (select/join/insert/update/delete) with types inferred from the sqlite schema. This makes later adoption of Electric live queries and Postgres sync straightforward.

- Behavior guarantees preserved
  - Duplicate avoidance, deterministic ordering, and contiguous `order_pos` rules are implemented in Drizzle.
  - Day assignments are true upserts via the unique composite index (user_id, weekday).

- Migration posture
  - DB init/seed logic still lives in the simple layer and Electric provider remains unchanged; this avoids destabilizing startup.
  - Workout sessions still use the simple (raw SQL) layer; slated for a later slice.

### How to apply this concept in future checkpoints

- Keep the UI contract stable
  - Swap implementation details behind the same function signatures. Callers don’t change; the risk stays low.

- Migrate in slices
  - Replace reads first (easy to validate), then writes (ensure idempotency and ordering), then remove the legacy path.

- Enforce list integrity centrally
  - Any list a user can reorder should have: contiguous indices, deterministic ordering, and idempotent add/remove.

- Prefer upsert where uniqueness is intentional
  - Back your upserts with real unique constraints (e.g., `(user_id, weekday)`), and use ORM conflict clauses.

- Map snake_case ↔ camelCase at the boundary only
  - Keep UI camelCase; handle DB naming in one place (data layer) to avoid leaks and repeated mapping.

- Prepare for live queries early
  - Design query functions so they can be wrapped by Electric live query hooks later without changing their signatures or shapes.

### Next steps in the Dataflow Overhaul

Short‑term
- Migrate Workout Sessions to Drizzle
  - Implement `getUserWorkoutSessions`, `createWorkoutSession`, `completeWorkoutSession` in a Drizzle data-access module, mirroring the behavior and shapes of the current simple layer.
  - Preserve state transitions (active → completed) and timestamps; keep return types identical.

- Indexes and small perf wins
  - Consider adding indexes like `split_exercises(split_id)` if lists grow.
  - Keep hydration costs low by deferring per‑split joins until needed.

Medium‑term (pre‑Electric)
- Centralize initialization/migrations
  - Codify local sqlite migrations and ensure schema drift is handled safely across app upgrades.
  - Generate and track drizzle migrations for Postgres (bodyPart already added) to prep for cloud.

- Retire legacy SimpleDataAccess gradually
  - Once workouts move to Drizzle and the app is stable, remove unused simple methods and keep only startup/seed pieces until Electric is wired.

Electric & Sync (later slice)
- Introduce Electric live queries
  - Start with Active Workout (sessions + exercises + sets) to validate reactivity.
  - Replace manual refetch/focus refresh with live updates.

- Wire cloud sync
  - Apply Drizzle migrations to Supabase; set RLS; electrify tables; verify offline edits sync correctly.

Success criteria for this slice
- Program Builder continues to work unchanged from the user’s perspective.
- Data access code is typed, testable, and ready to host live queries.
- No regressions in ordering, uniqueness, or upsert semantics.


## Here’s where to start and why, mapped onto your plan.

Where to begin the Drizzle/Electric swap
- Add a new “Checkpoint 3.5 — Drizzle swap (types + queries) for Program Builder” before CP4.
  - Low risk: swap internals under the already‑working CP3 UI without changing props/flows.
  - Goal: Drizzle types and query builder in place; Electric comes after.

Recommended sequence (from current state)
1) Drizzle-only for Program Builder (CP3.5)
- Freeze schema in code: mirror your current SQLite tables in schema.ts exactly (ids, created_at, body_part, split_day_assignments, split_exercises.order_pos).
- Generate types: use Drizzle’s $inferSelect/$inferInsert; replace manual row types (SplitRow, ExerciseRow, SplitExerciseJoin) with generated ones. Keep UI types (ProgramSplit, ProgramSplitWithExercises) unchanged.
- Replace reads first: re‑implement getAllExercises, getUserSplitsWithExerciseCounts, getSplitExercises using Drizzle’s query builder. Keep function signatures and return shapes identical.
- Replace writes next: re‑implement add/remove/reorder split exercises and day assignments using Drizzle transactions; preserve avoidDuplicates + contiguous order_pos semantics.
- Migrations: run Drizzle migrations locally without destructive changes (ensure they align with the already‑created tables; add no‑op/alter where needed).

2) Workout refactor with Drizzle (CP4a)
- Rewrite WorkoutContext to use Drizzle transactions for startWorkout/addSet/updateSet/endWorkout.
- Keep the UI on pull‑based refresh temporarily (focus/post‑mutation refetch).

3) Introduce Electric live queries where it matters most (CP4b)
- Wire Electric provider and use live queries for Active Workout (current workout, its exercises, its sets) to get push‑based updates and offline behavior.
- Leave Program Builder on refetch until stable.

4) Optional: Move Program Builder to live queries (CP5)
- Replace focus‑based refresh with live queries for splits and split_exercises if desired.

5) Cloud sync (CP6)
- Enable Electric replication to Supabase; apply Drizzle migrations in Supabase; configure RLS.

Conceptual roles (big picture)
- Drizzle: single source of truth for schema, generated types, and safe typed queries/transactions. Eliminates drift and manual row typings.
- Electric: offline‑first replication + live queries (push updates). UI updates automatically when relevant rows change; no manual refetch needed.

Current state vs later
- Now: manual SQL + manual row types + pull‑based refresh; UI types separate and stable.
- After CP3.5/CP4a: Drizzle types + ORM queries/transactions; same function signatures; UI unchanged.
- After CP4b+: Electric live queries for reactive parts; optional Program Builder adoption; then cloud sync.

Success criteria
- No changes to component props/state.
- Manual row types replaced by Drizzle’s generated types.
- Behaviors preserved (created_at ASC ordering, avoidDuplicates, contiguous order_pos).
- Active Workout gains live updates without manual refetch.
